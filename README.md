# UEVBS_net_gen
R code for creation of custom networks in randomly genarated spatial data (UEVBS project).

The purpose of the project is to create an accurate simulation of the entrworkj and extract performance metrics form the results.

The R files all have numbers in their title signifying the order they should be run in.

This is a work in progress (code will be changing).

"analysis_5.r" will be coming soon.

An ealy example of network fomration in genrated spacial data:

# UEVBS_net_gen
R code for creation of custom networks in randomly genarated spatial data (UEVBS project).

The purpose of the project is to create an accurate simulation of the network and extract performance metrics form the results.

The R files all have numbers in their title signifying the order they should be run in.

This is a work in progress (code will be changing often).

"analysis_5.r" will be coming soon.

An early example of network formation in generated spatial data:
